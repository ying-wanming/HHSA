# HHSA
The Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA) for rotation machine fault diagnosis

The original method was proposed by Norden E. Huang in 2016:

Huang N E, Hu K, Yang A C C, et al. On Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis: a full informational spectral representation for nonlinear and non-stationary data[J]. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 2016, 374(2065): 20150206.
